# multi_agent_orchestration_using_langgraph
A multi-agent AI system built using LangGraph and LangChain, where a Supervisor Agent intelligently orchestrates multiple specialized agents (Research, Search, Writing, Tools) to solve complex user queries using LLM-driven reasoning and tool execution.

This project demonstrates agent orchestration, ReAct reasoning, tool calling, and state-based workflows, similar to real-world AI automation systems.
