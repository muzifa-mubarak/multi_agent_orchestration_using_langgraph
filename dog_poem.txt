Ode to a Canine Companion

A bundle of fur, a playful yelp,
A tiny new friend, a joyful help.
With clumsy paws and eyes so bright,
You filled our home with pure delight.
A wagging tail, a happy bark,
You left your paw print on our heart.

Through sun and storm, a steadfast friend,
Your loyal heart knows no end.
A silent comfort, a knowing gaze,
You understand in countless ways.
A gentle nudge, a watchful eye,
Our faithful shadow, always nigh.

The chase for balls, a joyful leap,
Secrets of happiness you keep.
A rolling frolic on the grass,
Moments of pure joy, meant to last.
Your infectious spirit, free and bold,
A story of living, to be told.

No judgment in your loving stare,
A bond of trust beyond compare.
Forgiveness flows, a boundless stream,
You live out every loving dream.
A heart so pure, a love so true,
Reflected in everything you do.

A gentle snore, a contented sigh,
A head upon a lap, as moments fly.
The eager wait for walk or treat,
Life's simple rhythm, oh so sweet.
A paw that reaches, soft and warm,
Shelter from life's every storm.

You teach us patience, joy, and grace,
To find contentment in our place.
To live each moment, fresh and new,
With open heart, and spirit true.
A quiet wisdom, deep and kind,
The greatest lessons we can find.

More than a pet, a family's pride,
Forever walking by our side.
A cherished soul, a gift from above,
An endless source of purest love.
Our canine companion, dear and true,
Our world is brighter, thanks to you.
